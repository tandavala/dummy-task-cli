## DUMMY TASK CLI

Dummy Task CLI is a personal project of mine that serves as a testbed for practicing Python CLI development.

The idea behind this project is to create an interactive command-line interface (CLI) for creating 
tasks and associating them with their respective owners. I decided to keep the project simple, with the main goal being to learn how to develop a CLI and distribute it on the internet via PyPi. At the same time, I aim to make the source code available and write an article so that others can also use this knowledge to learn how to program a command-line interface using Python.

### Functional Requirement

- [ ] ***Task Creation***: Users can create new tasks by providing details such as title, description, due date, priority, and status
- [ ] ***Task Listing***: Users can list all existing tasks along with their details 
- [ ] ***Task Modification***: Users can modify existing tasks by updating their details 
- [ ] ***Task Deletion***: users can delete tasks from the task list 
- [ ] ***Task Filtering***: users can filter tasks from the task list
- [ ] ***Task Search***: users can search tasks based on phrases present in the task title
- [ ] ***Command-Line Help***: Comprehensive help documentation is provided accessible through the CLI to guide users on how to use various commands and options effectively
- [ ] ***Data Persistence***: Task data is persisted in SQLite database enabling users to access their tasks even after restarting the CLI
- [ ] ***Error handling***: RObust error handling mechanisms are implemented to handle invalid input, edge cases, and unexpected errors gracefully, providing informative error messages to users


### Non-functional Requirement

- [ ] ***CLI Navigation***: Design intuitive command-line navigation to help users navigate through different sections and functionalities of the CLI easily
- [ ] ***Integration with Eternal Tools***: provide options to integrate with external tools or services such as calendars, email clients to enhance task management capabilities
- [ ] ***Performance***: The CLI should responde quickly to user inputs and provide smooth task management functionality without significant delays
- [ ] ***Reliability***: The system should be reliable and stable, ensuring that tasks area accurately created, modified, and deleted without data loss or corruption
- [ ] ***Scalability***: The system should be scalable to handle a growing number of tasks and users without compromising performance or usability
- [ ] ***Compatibility***: The CLI tool should be compatible with various operating system (e.g Linux, MacOS, Linux)
- [ ] ***Maintainability***: The codebase should be well-structured, documented, and modular to facilitate ease of maintenance, debugging, and future enhancements
