## DUMMY TASK CLI

Dummy Task CLI is a personal project of mine that serves as a testbed for practicing Python CLI development.

The idea behind this project is to create an interactive command-line interface (CLI) for creating 
tasks and associating them with their respective owners. I decided to keep the project simple, with the main goal being to learn how to develop a CLI and distribute it on the internet via PyPi. At the same time, I aim to make the source code available and write an article so that others can also use this knowledge to learn how to program a command-line interface using Python.
